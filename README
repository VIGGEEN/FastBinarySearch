There are various way to compile the project.

VisualStudio 2015
The project by default compiles for AVX. Define NOAVX if you do not want it.
MKL is disabled by default. Define USE_MKL and add the appropriate LIB and INCLUDE paths if you want it.

GCC
Makefile is in the source directory
It compiles both on cygwin and linux
You need a quite recent version of g++
MKL is used only if MKLROOT is defined. Tested only in Linux with dynamic linking. Need to define LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
